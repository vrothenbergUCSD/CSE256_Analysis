Sentence: Sarah was a much better surgeon than Maria so _ always got the easier cases.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Sarah
[B] Maria
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is:

[A] Sarah

This is because the pronoun ""always"" refers back to the subject ""Sarah"", indicating that she was consistently assigned the easier cases. The sentence implies that Sarah's skills as a surgeon allowed her to get the easier cases, while Maria may have received more challenging cases."
1,0,0,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: Sarah was a much better surgeon than Maria so _ always got the harder cases.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Sarah
[B] Maria
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Sarah.

The reason is that ""the harder cases"" refers to the surgical cases that Sarah was given, since she is the subject of the comparative phrase ""a much better surgeon than Maria"". The sentence implies that because Sarah is a better surgeon, she gets the more challenging cases."
2,0,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: They were worried the wine would ruin the bed and the blanket, but the _ was't ruined.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] blanket
[B] bed
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","I'd choose [A] blanket.

The sentence suggests that ""they"" were worried about ruining either the bed or the blanket (or both). The phrase ""but the _ wasn't ruined"" implies that only one of them was affected. Since blankets are more likely to be damaged by wine than beds, it's more plausible that the blanket was spared. Therefore, [A] blanket is the most reasonable choice to resolve the ambiguity."

Sentence: Terry tried to bake the eggplant in the toaster oven but the _ was too big.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] eggplant
[B] toaster
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] eggplant.

In this sentence, the pronoun ""the"" refers back to the noun ""eggplant"", which was previously mentioned as the thing being tried to be baked in the toaster oven. The phrase ""the was too big"" indicates that the problem is not with the toaster oven itself (which would require ""B""), but rather with the size of the eggplant."

Sentence: At night, Jeffrey always stays up later than Hunter to watch TV because _ wakes up late.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Jeffrey
[B] Hunter
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Jeffrey.

In this sentence, ""wakes up late"" refers to the person who stays up later than Hunter, which is Jeffrey. The pronoun ""_"" in the sentence should be replaced with ""Jeffrey"", as it is describing the action of staying up later than Hunter."
5,0,0,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: The cat of Sarah has some mouth problems, so she takes it to see Maria. _ is a responsible cat owner.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Sarah
[B] Maria
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Sarah.

The pronoun ""she"" in the sentence refers back to ""Sarah"", indicating that Sarah takes her cat (the cat of Sarah) to see Maria. The phrase ""_ is a responsible cat owner"" then describes Sarah as someone who takes care of her cat's mouth problems, rather than implying that Maria is the responsible cat owner."
6,1,0,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: The home that my parents had when I was in school was a lot nicer than my house now because the _ was sophisticated.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] home
[B] house
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","After analyzing the sentence, I would choose:

[B] house

Here's why: The pronoun ""the"" refers back to ""my house now"", which is the most recent mention of a dwelling in the sentence. Therefore, it makes sense that the comparison is between the old home and my current house.

So, [B] house resolves the ambiguity!"
7,1,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: The home that my parents had when I was in school was a lot nicer than my house now because the _ is trashy.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] home
[B] house
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] house.

In this sentence, the pronoun ""my"" refers back to ""house"", not ""home"". The phrase ""the home that my parents had when I was in school"" is a subordinate clause describing a previous home of the speaker's parents. Therefore, ""trashy"" is intended to describe the speaker's current house, which is being compared unfavorably with their childhood home."
8,1,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: Natalie has a rich husband and lots of money, Jennifer is poor _ needs to make her clothes.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Natalie
[B] Jennifer

The sentence implies that it is Jennifer who is poor and needs to make her own clothes, not Natalie. The ambiguous pronoun ""her"" refers back to Jennifer, resolving the ambiguity."

Sentence: Joe immediately went to bakery before the bank because the _ had a limited supply of what he wanted.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] bakery
[B] bank
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] bakery.

The pronoun ""what"" refers back to ""limited supply of"" which is describing something that can be found at the bakery, not the bank. Therefore, the sentence makes sense if we replace the underlined pronoun with ""bakery""."
10,1,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: Joe immediately went to bakery before the bank because the _ had a substantial supply of what he wanted.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] bakery
[B] bank
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is:

[B] bank

The sentence is ambiguous because ""the"" can refer to either the bakery or the bank, but the most likely interpretation is that ""the"" refers back to ""bank"", implying that Joe went to the bank before going to the bakery because it had a substantial supply of what he wanted."
11,0,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: I had to read an entire story for class tomorrow. Luckily, the _ was canceled.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] story
[B] class
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] story.

In this sentence, ""the"" refers back to ""an entire story"", indicating that the event (canceled) was a part of that story. It's not referring to ""class"", which would be an odd thing to cancel!"

Sentence: I had to read an entire story for class tomorrow. Luckily, the _ was short.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] story
[B] class
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","I would choose [A] story.

In this sentence, ""the"" is a definite article referring to an unspecified noun that has been mentioned earlier in the conversation or text. Since we're talking about reading a story for class, it's likely that ""the story"" was meant. This choice resolves the ambiguity and makes the sentence grammatically correct and clear."
13,1,0,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: He had enough time between classes to go to a cafe or to the library. He went to the _ because his paper could wait.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] cafe
[B] library
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","I would choose [B] library.

The pronoun ""He"" is ambiguous because it can refer to either the subject who went to a cafe or the subject who went to the library. However, based on the phrase ""his paper could wait"", I infer that ""he"" refers to the person who was working on the paper, which implies that he went to the library (to work on his paper) rather than going to the cafe.

So, the correct resolution of the ambiguity is [B] library."
14,1,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: He had enough time between classes to go to a cafe or to the library. He went to the _ because his paper was due soon.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] cafe

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] library.

The pronoun ""He"" refers back to the subject who had a paper that was due soon, implying that this person went to the library to work on their paper. Going to a cafe wouldn't make sense in this context because there's no indication of them doing any academic work there.

So, the resolution of the ambiguity is [B] library."
15,0,0,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: Lindsey like to read graphic novels but Natalie liked classic literature to read. _ bought the new Frank Miller comic at the book store.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Lindsey
[B] Natalie
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct resolution is:

[B] Natalie

Explanation: The sentence suggests that Lindsey likes graphic novels, but it doesn't specify whether she bought the comic or not. The pronoun ""she"" refers to someone who likes classic literature, which is Natalie. Therefore, Natalie is the one who bought the new Frank Miller comic at the book store.

Choice [A] Lindsey does not resolve the ambiguity because there's no indication that Lindsey is the one who bought the comic."
16,0,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: Michael just bought brand new wheels for his truck unlike Leslie because _ wheels were new and perfect.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Michael
[B] Leslie
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Michael.

In this sentence, ""his"" refers back to the subject ""Michael"", indicating that the pronoun ""his"" modifies ""truck"". This makes sense because it is Michael who just bought new wheels for his truck. The phrase ""unlike Leslie"" is a contrasting clause, and ""because his wheels were new and perfect"" is a reason why Michael got the new wheels.

If we chose [B] Leslie, it would mean that Leslie's truck was brand new and perfect, which doesn't make sense in this context."
17,1,0,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: Michael just bought brand new wheels for his truck unlike Leslie because _ wheels were old and used.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Michael
[B] Leslie
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] Leslie.

Here's why:

In this sentence, ""his"" is an ambiguous pronoun that could refer to either Michael or Leslie. However, since we know that Leslie already has old and used wheels, it makes more sense for the new wheels to belong to Leslie, rather than Michael. Therefore, the correct resolution of the ambiguity is [B] Leslie."
18,1,0,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: Leslie was nervous around parrots but Neil was not, since _ was bitten by a bird early in life.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Leslie
[B] Neil

The sentence implies that the subject who was bitten by a parrot early in life is Neil, not Leslie. Therefore, the pronoun ""who"" should refer back to Neil."
19,1,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: Christmas was a special holiday to Eric but not Adam since _ was a Jew.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Eric
[B] Adam
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] Adam.

In this sentence, ""since"" indicates a contrasting condition, implying that Adam's being a Jew explains why Christmas was not special to him. Therefore, the pronoun ""who"" (which is implied by the sentence) refers back to Adam."

Sentence: To make frosting I needed pudding that was at a store 15 minutes away but pre-made frosting was at a store 5 minutes away.  The _ was closer.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] pudding
[B] frosting
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","I would choose [B] frosting.

The sentence is saying that there are two options for getting what's needed to make frosting (either pudding or pre-made frosting), and the question is asking which one was closer. Since the sentence is asking about making frosting, it makes sense that ""the _ was closer"" refers to the proximity of the pre-made frosting compared to the pudding.

So, [B] frosting resolves the ambiguity by pointing to the correct antecedent in the sentence!"

[A] Benjamin

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Cynthia

[A] work
[B] strength
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] strength.

The sentence should read: ""They had to eat a lot to gain the strength they had lost and be able to work, the strength was too much.""

This resolution makes sense because it's unlikely that someone would have to eat a lot in order to gain the ability to work. However, it is plausible that someone who has lost strength might need to eat more to regain their strength."
24,1,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.

[A] Rachel
[B] Betty
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Rachel.

In this sentence, ""the home value of _"" refers to the value of Rachel's home and Betty's home. Since we are comparing the values of both homes, it is more likely that the pronoun ""of"" is referring back to ""Rachel's home"" rather than ""Betty's"".

So, the correct resolution would be: The roof of Rachel's home is old and falling apart, while Betty's is new. The home value of Rachel's is lower."

Sentence: All the clutter in the house excited Leslie but not Derrick because cleaning energized _ very much.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Leslie
[B] Derrick
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] Derrick.

In this sentence, ""because"" introduces a subordinate clause that explains why Derrick didn't get excited about cleaning. The pronoun ""very much"" refers back to ""Derrick"", indicating that he was not energized very much by cleaning.

So, the sentence can be paraphrased as: All the clutter in the house excited Leslie, but not Derrick because cleaning did not energize him very much."

28,0,0,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: Since Craig threw aluminum cans in the trash and Benjamin recycled, _ was environmentally irresponsible.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Craig
[B] Benjamin
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Craig.

The reason is that ""and"" indicates a continuation of the action of Craig, implying that he threw some cans in the trash but also threw others (aluminum cans) which were not recycled. This makes Craig's actions environmentally irresponsible. Benjamin's recycling action does not imply any environmental irresponsibility on his part.

So, the sentence suggests that it was Craig who did something environmentally irresponsible, which is option [A]."

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] desks
[B] pencils
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] desks.

Explanation:

In the sentence, ""they"" refers back to the students mentioned earlier in the sentence. The question is what did they use to hold their papers? The most logical and reasonable interpretation is that they used their desks to hold their papers. Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" should be resolved with [A] desks."

Sentence: Mary thought poodles were a cool dog but Rachel thought Great Danes were cooler. _ bought a small dog bed for their pet.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Mary
[B] Rachel
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] Rachel.

The sentence implies that ""their"" refers to the owner(s) of the Great Danes, which would be Rachel. Therefore, the subject-verb agreement suggests that Rachel bought a small dog bed for her pet."
32,1,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: Mary thought poodles were a cool dog but Rachel thought Great Danes were cooler. _ bought a gigantic dog bed for their pet.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Mary
[B] Rachel
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] Rachel.

Here's why:

In this sentence, ""their"" refers to the possessive form of the subject that is performing the action of buying. Since it is stated that there are two individuals mentioned (Mary and Rachel), we need to determine which one is performing the action. Given the context, it makes more sense for Rachel to be the one who bought a dog bed for their pet, implying that she has a Great Dane as her pet.

In this sentence, ""their"" is ambiguous because it could refer to either Mary or Rachel. However, based on the sentence structure and meaning, ""Rachel"" is the most likely antecedent of the pronoun ""their""."

Sentence: Jessica enjoyed a simple, basic life with Betty, but _ was bored having a quiet existence.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Jessica
[B] Betty
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Jessica.

In this sentence, ""Jessica"" is the subject who enjoyed a simple life, and it makes sense that she would be described as being bored with a quiet existence. The pronoun ""was"" refers back to ""Jessica"", indicating that it was Jessica who was bored.

[Betty] does not fit logically in this sentence, as Betty is described as sharing a life with Jessica, but there is no indication that Betty is the one who is bored."
35,1,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: I wanted to build a bathroom on the third floor of the house but I couldn't because the _ would be too full.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] bathroom

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] floor.

The sentence is ambiguous because ""I"" can refer to either the person who wanted to build a bathroom (the subject) or the person who couldn't do it (still the subject). However, the phrase ""the _ would be too full"" implies that it's not possible to have a bathroom on that floor because it would be overcrowded. Therefore, the correct resolution is that ""I"" refers to the person who wanted to build a bathroom and ""the _"" refers to the third floor, making [B] floor the correct choice."

The first clause states that Donald's understanding of math isn't as good as Joseph's, and the second clause says that because of this, something (which is described by the pronoun) is more likely to be a professor. Since we're talking about Donald's characteristics being compared to Joseph's, it makes sense to imply that the ""something"" referred to in the second clause is Donald himself."

[A] letters

Explanation: In this sentence, ""the"" refers back to ""letters"", which is a plural noun. Therefore, it's most likely that ""his"" also refers to ""letters"", indicating possession (i.e., someone else's letters). This interpretation makes the most sense in the context of the sentence."

[A] dress
[B] hat
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] hat.

The pronoun ""she"" in the sentence refers back to Jill, and since it's describing a part of her outfit, it logically refers to the old hat. The idea is that she wants the old hat to be less noticeable, not the new dress."
43,0,0,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: Jill was on a budget so she only bought a new dress for the ceremony and wore an old hat. She figured the _ would be more noticeable.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] dress
[B] hat
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] dress.

In this sentence, ""the"" should refer back to the noun that is most closely related in meaning to ""be more noticeable"". Since ""dress"" is a new and important item purchased for the ceremony, it makes sense that Jill would want something about her dress to be noticeable. On the other hand, an old hat is not a significant or notable part of one's attire.

So, the sentence should read: ""She figured the dress would be more noticeable."""

The sentence is saying that someone (Felicia) does not like fried eggs, implying that it's her preference or characteristic. The pronoun ""does not like"" refers back to Felicia, making her the subject of the sentence.

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] newspaper
[B] comics
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","After analyzing the sentence, I believe the correct resolution is:

[B] comics

The reasoning is that ""so"" introduces a cause-and-effect relationship, implying that the speaker gets the newspaper in order to look at the comics. Therefore, the pronoun ""I"" refers back to the previous mention of ""I"", and the ambiguity is resolved by choosing the comics as the object of interest.

So, the corrected sentence would be: ""This is the only reason I still get the comics in this day and age."""

The sentence should read: ""Jennifer was more of a morning person than Natalie because she always went to bed early and got a good night's rest.""

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Matthew.

The pronoun ""is"" refers back to ""Alcohol"", which is a noun that can be possessed by someone. The sentence implies that Matthew has a love for alcohol, but Ryan doesn't. Therefore, the subject of the sentence is ""Matthew's"", and the pronoun ""is"" should refer to him."

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] food
[B] distance
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","After analyzing the sentence, I believe the correct answer is:

[A] food

The reason is that ""him"" refers to the horse, and it's more likely that Joe gave food to the horse rather than the distance. The phrase ""too much"" implies an excessive amount of something, which makes sense in the context of feeding a horse.

So, the revised sentence would be: ""Joe brought the horse out to the country quite a distance and gave him food, but the food was too much."""

The sentence suggests that Dennis's knees are the reason for his hesitation, and therefore it is likely that ""his"" refers to Dennis.

In this sentence, the pronoun ""were"" refers back to ""nozzles"", indicating that the nozzles were dirty after being polished. The use of a plural noun and a singular verb (were) is an example of a construction called ""plural of majesty"", where the subject of the sentence is referred to with a plural form, even though it's a single entity.

Therefore, it must be referring back to ""ear"", which was already mentioned in the sentence.

In this sentence, ""because"" introduces a contrasting reason for why Rebecca can't play chess.

Here's why:

* ""them"" refers back to the subject-verb phrase ""the plan devised by Christine"", which is about Christine's plan.
* The sentence suggests that Christine was trying to get Kayla to like her (Christine), not the other way around. Therefore, it makes more sense for the pronoun ""they"" to refer back to Christine.

The sentence should read: ""Throughout the practice Megan pushed the limits of herself to get ready for the game because she was the athlete.""

In this sentence, ""their"" is ambiguous because it can refer either to Carrie or the sofa. However, since an offer can be accepted or declined, but a sofa cannot, the pronoun must be referring to the offer. Therefore, the correct resolution of the ambiguity is to choose option A: ""offer""."

In this sentence, ""their"" is a possessive pronoun that refers to the president's speech, indicating that it was located at the auditorium. The sentence does not imply joint ownership or possession by anyone else, so ""auditorium"" is the most likely referent for ""their""."

The sentence is ambiguous because ""their"" could refer to either the president or an unknown plural noun.

In this sentence, ""then"" is a subordinating conjunction introducing a dependent clause that describes the consequence or result of Robert's reaction.

The sentence is trying to say that when Steven found out his T-shirt had shrunk, he initially laughed, but then became apologetic. The pronoun ""their"" earlier in the sentence refers back to Steven's shirt, not Robert's. Therefore, the subject of the clause ""became apologetic"" should be Steven as well.

Robert is introduced later in the sentence and doesn't have any direct connection to the event described by ""When Steven found...""."

The sentence should read: ""She counted her calories for her diet and found she needed more so she ate a brownie instead of an apple since apples have fewer.""

Here's why: The sentence says ""Felicia liked wearing glasses more than braces..."", which implies that Felicia has to wear both glasses and braces.

In this sentence, ""it"" is a pronoun that refers back to something mentioned earlier in the sentence. The previous clause mentions two people: Adam and Joseph. Given the context, it is more likely that ""it"" refers to Adam, who is described as law-abiding, rather than Joseph, who is not characterized as such.

In this sentence, the phrase ""after started cutting back on efficiency"" refers to the subject that performed the action described by ""started"".

[B] jewelry

My reasoning is that ""the"" preceding ""jewelry sold for less than..."" implies a comparison between the value of the jewelry and something else. The phrase ""since the was very common"" suggests that what came before (""what was very common"") is being compared to something else that is uncommon or rare. Therefore, it makes more sense to assume that the baseball card (the rare and valuable item) is the subject of the sentence, rather than the jewelry.

In contrast, if we chose [A] Jessica, the sentence would suggest that someone (again represented by ""they"") is asking Jessica and herself (not Mary) not to decorate the house alone.

The sentence says ""having lost the _"" and then provides two options: ""watch"" or ""clocktower"".

Therefore, it's most likely that the man lost his watch, not the clocktower.

So, resolving the ambiguity, I choose [A] watch."

In this sentence, ""is"" is a singular pronoun that refers back to ""Michael"", making it clear that Michael is the one who is unconcerned about their health. If we chose [A] Hunter, the sentence would imply that Hunter is unconcerned about their own health, which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] office
[B] house
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] office.

In the sentence, ""the audit"" refers to an event that can occur in either the house or the office. The pronoun ""which"" introduces a dependent clause that describes the possible locations of the audit. Therefore, it is most likely that Tim chose a comfortable setting for the office, which is also the location where he would typically conduct professional business.

The ambiguity arises because the sentence doesn't specify whether Tim received the letter at home or at work. However, by choosing [A] office, we resolve the ambiguity in favor of the more plausible scenario given the context."

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Patricia
[B] Felicia
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Patricia.

The pronoun ""they"" refers back to Patricia, as it is her who had been through a lot and just inherited some money. This resolution makes sense because it implies that Patricia's decision to buy Felicia dinner is motivated by their shared experience and newfound financial situation.

Option [B] would create confusion, as it would imply that Felicia had also gone through a difficult time and inherited money, which isn't supported by the original sentence."

In this sentence, ""that"" is a relative pronoun introducing a clause that provides evidence for Sarah's thought about Elena. The ambiguous pronoun is ""_"", which refers back to the subject of the main clause, ""Sarah"". Therefore, the sentence should read: ""Sarah thought that she had a very full suitcase.""

So, choice [A] Sarah resolves the ambiguity by making it clear that ""she"" refers to Sarah herself, not Elena."

In this sentence, ""so"" introduces a contrast to what came before, and the pronoun should refer back to the subject who liked being outside more (William).

The sentence suggests that John never mentioned his canoe and had a conversation about a different type of watercraft (the raft).

Sentence: Monica gives Jessica a book about posture, because _ has been trying to get better at ballet dancing.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Monica

In this sentence, ""because"" introduces a dependent clause that provides the reason for Monica giving Jessica a book. The subject of the dependent clause (""has been trying to get better at ballet dancing"") must be the same as the giver in the main clause (""Monica""). This is because it's Monica who has been trying to help Jessica improve her posture, which is necessary for ballet dancing.

So, the pronoun ""has"" refers back to Monica, not Jessica."

Explanation:

In the sentence, ""pushover"" is an idiomatic expression that means someone who can be easily persuaded or pushed around.

Therefore, [A] Eric resolves the ambiguity and provides a coherent interpretation of the sentence."

In the second event, Kerry took a taxi because he ran into more traffic. The ambiguous pronoun ""he"" can refer to either Kerry or someone else who took a taxi.

The sentence implies that Neil was searching for his own missing dog, and then Samuel helped him get it back.

The reason is that ""the color"" refers to the adjective phrase ""pink"", which is describing the rose flowers. The sentence is saying that the speaker didn't buy pink rose flowers for their wedding because they're too bright.

The word ""color"" is a common noun, and in this context, it's referring to the property of being pink. This resolution makes sense grammatically and semantically.

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] garage.

The reason is that the sentence implies a contrast between playing drums in the garage (where it's okay to make noise) and playing drums in my room (which might not be acceptable). Therefore, ""my parents preferred knowing I was in the garage"" makes more sense than ""my parents preferred knowing I was in the room"", as it would imply that they were okay with the noise level in the garage but not in the room."

183,1,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: The sand and water in the fish tank were very dirty, so the _ needed to be scrubbed.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] water

The sentence implies that the subject (the thing that ""needed to be scrubbed"") is something that typically needs cleaning, and it's likely referring to the fish tank itself or its contents. Given the context of a dirty fish tank with sand and water, it makes more sense that the thing that needs cleaning is the sandy substrate in the tank, rather than the water.

In this sentence, ""the"" refers back to ""a globe of the world made of PVC"", which means that it should be replaced with ""this"". However, since ""this"" doesn't fit grammatically in this context, we can substitute it with ""it"" instead. Therefore, the correct pronoun is [B] PVC.

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Matthew

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Matthew.

Here's why:

In high school Matthew was most popular among the teachers as were Steven was among the students, _ was liked by adolescents.

The sentence is describing two people: Matthew and Steven. The phrase ""as were Steven"" is a relative clause modifying ""Matthew"", indicating that both Matthew and Steven shared similar popularity characteristics. This means that ""Matthew"" is the subject of the main clause, and ""Steven"" is being compared to it.

Therefore, the blank should be filled with the pronoun referring back to the subject of the main clause, which is [A] Matthew."

In this sentence, the pronoun ""because"" introduces a contrasting clause that explains why Lawrence and Jason have different preferences for watching movies. The sentence implies that Lawrence likes foreign movies with subtitles because he appreciates the original language of the film, whereas someone else (Jason) criticizes it. Therefore, the subject performing the action of criticizing is likely to be Lawrence himself, which resolves the ambiguity."

In this sentence, ""the"" refers back to the subject ""fishing line"", which is the thing that is doing the snagging and breaking. The sentence is describing an action performed by the fishing line, so it makes sense for ""the"" to refer back to the fishing line.

The rock is not performing any actions in this sentence, it's just a stationary object that the fishing line has snagged and broken on. Therefore, option [B] rock does not resolve the ambiguity correctly."

In this sentence, the pronoun ""had"" is ambiguous because it could refer to either Victoria or Elena. However, based on the context and the clause structure, it's more likely that ""had"" refers back to Victoria, who was still grieving the death of a friend.

[A] past due

The reason is that ""I"" (the speaker) is referring to themselves as a new customer, which means they are talking about their own situation. The phrase ""past due"" makes more sense in this context, implying that the bill was overdue because of the speaker's status as a new customer.

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] glasses
[B] contacts
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] glasses.

The pronoun ""I"" in the first clause refers to the subject, and the second ""I"" refers back to the same subject. The sentence is describing one person's experience, so the antecedent of the second ""I"" must be the same person described by the first ""I"". Therefore, the correct resolution is that the pronoun ""seem less comfortable"" refers to glasses, not contacts.

The sentence suggests that ""it"" refers back to ""an article of faith"" which is a general principle or a guiding idea. Therefore, it makes more sense for ""it"" to refer to ""the exam"", implying that even though the exam weighs less heavily on the grade, it is still considered more important than the paper."

[A] supermarket
[B] diner
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] supermarket.

The sentence suggests that Kevin was told to exercise more often, implying that he is the one who had been lazy and unmotivated. The contrast between what ""he"" (referring to Kevin) did in the past and Neil's lack of a similar problem creates the ambiguity, but the most natural resolution is that ""he"" refers back to Kevin."
266,1,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Kevin

In the original sentence, ""not"" introduces a negative clause that modifies the verb ""told"", implying that what was not told to Neil was something. The pronoun ""_ had always been active and self-motivated"" refers back to ""Neil"", as it is describing his typical behavior before being given advice by the doctor.

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] library.

Here's why:

In the sentence, ""the amount of people at the ____"" refers back to the previous mention of ""people"". The pronoun ""at the ____"" should refer to a location where there are many people, which is described as a library in the first clause. Therefore, it makes sense that the sentence intends to say that the large number of people in the library would make it hard to concentrate.

The option [B] house doesn't work because the context suggests that ""people"" refers to those reading in a public place, which is a library, not someone's home."

Explanation: The sentence suggests that ""the"" refers back to the fruit from which the juice comes, rather than the container (cup) that cannot be filled.

In this sentence, ""the"" refers back to ""pie"", not ""cookies"". The pronoun ""which"" is ambiguous because it can refer to either ""cookies"" or ""pie"", but the context suggests that ""which"" is referring to the thing that requires sharing with fewer people. Since a pie typically requires more people to eat than cookies, the sentence implies that the speaker chose cookies over pie because they could be shared with fewer people."

The reason is that the sentence implies a contrast between the dirt on the car and the bike. The phrase ""the _ was kept outside"" is likely referring to the thing that's being compared (i.e., the car). If it were the bike that was kept outside, the comparison would be redundant, and we wouldn't expect a distinction made about the car's cleanliness.

The sentence is ambiguous because it's unclear who ""is a very good cook"" refers to.

Therefore, the pronoun ""one"" in the sentence should refer back to ""a restaurant""."

The sentence indicates that Justin received a demand letter, and after two weeks, someone (referring back to ""Justin"") will sue him in court. The pronoun ""him"" refers back to ""Justin"", not ""Hunter"". Therefore, the ambiguity is resolved by choosing [B] Justin."

Sentence: The mediation and medication both helped me be patient.  I lost my temper when the _ got rescheduled.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] medication
[B] mediation
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","I would choose [B] mediation.

The sentence is suggesting that ""the mediation"" was rescheduled, which caused the speaker to lose their temper. This interpretation makes sense in the context of the original sentence, where mediation and medication are both helping the speaker be patient. If we chose [A] medication instead, it would imply that the speaker's temper was somehow related to taking medication, which doesn't fit with the rest of the sentence's tone or meaning.

So, resolving the ambiguity by choosing [B] mediation maintains the coherence and logical flow of the original sentence!"

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Jason

[A] Jason

This is because ""he"" refers back to ""Jason"", who is the subject performing the action of considering someone to be friends. The sentence is saying that Jason considers himself and Benjamin to be friends, so Jason puts a lot of effort into their relationship.

If we chose [B] Benjamin, it would imply that Benjamin is considering themselves and Jason to be friends, which doesn't make sense in this context."

Explanation:

In the sentence, ""he"" refers back to ""Jason"", not ""Benjamin"". This is because ""Jason considers he and Benjamin..."". If it were ""Benjamin considers he and Benjamin..."", then ""he"" would refer to ""Benjamin"".

So, the corrected sentence would be: Jason considers he and Benjamin to be friends even though Jason puts little effort into their relationship."

In the sentence, ""the"" is a pronoun that refers back to something mentioned earlier in the sentence. In this case, it's referring to one of the two substances mentioned: chocolate or caramel. Since ""it"" was previously talking about the melting time of one of these substances (specifically, the chocolate), it makes sense that ""the"" would refer to the same substance - the chocolate."

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] budget

The pronoun ""was"" refers back to the noun that is closest in time and space, which is the meeting. Therefore, the sentence should read:

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] bedroom
[B] bathroom
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] bedroom.

Here's why:

In this sentence, ""the"" is a pronoun referring back to ""either the plain bathroom or the colorful bedroom"". The original sentence implies that Matt wanted to change one of these two rooms. Then it says ""but the _ was already colorful"", which suggests that the room being referred to as ""already colorful"" is the same room Matt wanted to change.

Given this context, the most likely interpretation is that ""the"" refers back to ""bedroom"". This is because a bedroom is more likely to be expected to have some level of color and decoration, whereas a bathroom might typically be plain and functional. Therefore, it's more plausible that Matt wanted to change the colorful bedroom.

In contrast, if we chose [B] bathroom, the sentence would imply that Matt wanted to change a plain bathroom, but then suddenly the same room was already colorful - which doesn't make sense!"

Here's why: The sentence implies that the police arrested someone (Maria) because they had paint on their hand, which suggests that Maria was the one who was caught with evidence of graffiti activity. The fact that Cynthia was let go doesn't necessarily mean she was also involved in the graffiti incident, but rather perhaps had a legitimate reason for being at the scene or was not found to be involved.

So, the pronoun ""they"" (referring to someone with paint on their hand) is more likely to refer back to Maria than Cynthia."

In this sentence, ""their"" refers to the subject of the verb phrase ""went to the doctor"", which is ""Jeffrey"". The pronoun ""their"" agrees with Jeffrey in number (singular) and person (third), indicating that Jeffrey went to the doctor for his own ailments.

The sentence is ambiguous because it's unclear who owns the Apple phone - Aaron or Donald. The phrase ""because he owned an apple phone"" could refer to either of them.

In the sentence, ""because"" introduces a subordinate clause that provides a reason why the comparison between Katrina and Felicia is being made. The subject of this subordinate clause must be the same as the subject implied by the verb ""turned out to be"".

Here's why:

In this sentence, ""was"" is a plural verb agreeing with ""friendships"", indicating that the subject of the sentence is singular.

The reason is that ""expedient"" implies a sense of efficiency or timeliness, which is more relevant to an interview preparation (e.g., doing what's necessary quickly) rather than a sporting activity.

The pronoun ""I"" refers to the same person who has both glasses and contacts, so it must refer back to the subject ""I"" in the first clause of the sentence.

Explanation:
In this sentence, ""it"" refers back to ""the e-mail"", which makes sense because it's easier to write an email with fewer words. The phrase ""write the letter"" sets up a contrast between writing a letter and sending an email, making ""e-mail"" the more likely antecedent for ""it""."

The reason is that ""Eric's infections"" is a possessive noun phrase indicating that someone (Eric) has some kind of infection.

In the sentence, ""whereas"" introduces a contrasting clause, indicating that Benjamin's actions are opposite to those described earlier.

Sentence: Ben had to drain both water and oil down the sink, but the _ was too viscous.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] oil
[B] water

In this sentence, ""the"" refers back to the plural noun phrase ""both water and oil"". Since it's unclear which of the two substances is being described as too viscous, we can infer that ""water"" is more likely to be referred to because water is typically less viscous than oil. This ambiguity can be resolved by choosing [B] water."

Sentence: Ben had to drain both water and oil down the sink, but the _ was too fluid.

In this sentence, ""both water and oil"" refers to two substances being drained down the sink. The pronoun ""the"" should refer back to one of these substances, which is more likely to be described as ""too fluid"". Oil is generally more fluid than water, so it's the better choice to resolve the ambiguity.

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] frame

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","After analyzing the sentence, I think the correct answer is:

[B] pole

Here's why: The sentence states that John painted the pole red, which means the pole has a distinct color. Later, it says ""now the _ is contrasting"", implying that something else is different from the pole. Since the pole was already painted red, it makes sense that the frame (which was previously unpainted or white) would be the thing contrasting with the pole.

So, the pronoun ""the"" in this sentence refers back to the frame, which was not mentioned as being painted red initially."

The sentence implies that John painted two separate entities: the pole (which was previously red) and the frame (which was painted white). The pronoun ""now the _ is similar"" refers to the color of the pole, which was previously red but is now similar in color to the wall. Therefore, the correct answer is [B] pole."

Respond with one of the following choices:

[B] Sarah

The reason is that ""unlike Sarah"" sets up a contrast between two individuals (Monica and Sarah), implying that Sarah's situation with her loan is different from Monica's. Therefore, it makes more sense to refer back to Sarah as the infrequent gambler.

So, the corrected sentence would be: Monica had trouble paying off their loan unlike Sarah because she was an infrequent gambler.

The pronoun ""who"" is ambiguous because it could refer to either Kevin or Ian, but in this sentence, it's more likely that Ian is giving blood to do some tests. If Ian was not willing to give blood, Kevin would not need to draw the blood from his arm. Therefore, [B] Ian resolves the ambiguity."

In this sentence, ""everyone in her family"" refers to a group of people who are familiar with Sookie's family traditions. The sentence implies that if Sookie had served carrots instead of potatoes, everyone would have hated it because it's not a typical choice for the family meal.

Here's why:

* ""Betty learned to play the cello well"" sets up a clear subject-verb agreement, indicating that Betty has some musical talent.
* The sentence then introduces Erin as an antonym, stating ""Erin did not [learn to play the cello]"" because of the reason that follows: ""because [someone] was very impatient.""
* Since Erin didn't learn to play the cello well (or at all), it's unlikely that Erin would be described as ""impatient"" due to their own lack of musical skills.
* Therefore, it's more likely that the sentence is describing Betty as impatient, implying that her impatience prevented Erin from learning to play the cello."

Here's why:

* The sentence implies that the speaker is talking about two people, Erin and Betty.
* Since the sentence starts by describing Erin's behavior, it's more likely that the pronoun ""had"" refers back to Erin rather than Betty.
* If we interpret the sentence as meaning ""Betty had skipped lunch"", it would imply that Betty was eating less for dinner because she skipped lunch, which doesn't fit with the rest of the sentence.

In the original sentence, ""because"" implies that the event or action described by the subordinate clause is related to when each woman became a mother.

The sentence implies that Patricia had her child before Erin, and since ""a teenager"" cannot be applied to someone's age at the time they became a mother (because ""teenager"" refers to an older age range), we can conclude that Erin must have become a mother later. Therefore, it was Patricia who became a mother first.

The sentence is structured to imply a contrast between the ages of the children, with ""a teenager"" indicating Erin's child is much older than ""toddler-age"", which implies Patricia's child is younger. This contrast suggests that Patricia had her child before Erin, making [B] Patricia the correct choice."

If we choose option [A] Jessica, it would not resolve the ambiguity because it assumes that ""they"" refers to ""Jessica"", but in reality, ""they"" could be referring to either Jessica or Felicia."

Sentence: Samantha had to use the potty while Felicia used the restroom because _ is a grownup.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Samantha
[B] Felicia
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Samantha.

In this sentence, the pronoun ""is"" refers back to the subject Samantha, indicating that she is a grownup. This makes sense in the context of the sentence, as it explains why Samantha can use the potty while Felicia uses the restroom.

Felicia is not a grownup, according to the sentence, and therefore would not be a suitable referent for ""is""."

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] foot
[B] water

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Benjamin
[B] Adam

The sentence suggests that the judge's sympathetic look was in response to the financial difficulties caused by Benjamin putting the family into debt, rather than the divorce filing by Adam. The pronoun ""a"" refers back to the subject who has just been mentioned, which is Benjamin."
410,1,0,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.

Respond with one of the following choices:

The sentence implies that when Benjamin put the family into debt, it was likely due to his actions or decisions, and as a result, Adam (the husband) filed for divorce. Therefore, the judge's withering look would be directed at Adam, who is responsible for filing for divorce."

Sentence: Erin read a book to Monica because _ was old enough to be able to read.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Erin
[B] Monica
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] Monica.

In this sentence, ""to"" is a preposition indicating the recipient of the action (reading), and ""because"" introduces a subordinate clause explaining why the reading was done. The pronoun ""was old enough to be able to read"" refers back to the person who could read, which is Monica in this case."

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] glove
[B] hand
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] hand.

In the sentence, ""it"" refers back to ""hand"", which is the noun that was mentioned earlier in the sentence. The phrase ""lift it again"" implies that James lifted his own hand, not the glove. Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""hand"", making option [B] the correct choice."
413,1,0,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: The box slid down James hand when he was wearing a glove, hence he removed it and lift it again. The _ is slippery.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] glove

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] hand.

The sentence is ambiguous because ""it"" could refer to either the glove or the box. However, since the phrase ""lift it again"" suggests that James lifted the box, not his own hand, the pronoun must be referring to the box. Therefore, the correct resolution of the ambiguity is to choose [B] hand."

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] foundation

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] foundation.

In this sentence, ""the"" is a definite article referring back to the noun ""foundation"", making it clear that the foundation was being strengthened. The phrase ""with a steel alloy"" modifies the verb ""was re-enforced"" and describes what was done to the foundation, rather than implying that the steel alloy itself was being strengthened.

Choice [B] would create an unclear meaning, suggesting that the strength of the steel alloy is the reason for the strengthening, which doesn't make sense in this context."

[B] water bottles
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] water bottles.

In this sentence, ""it"" refers back to ""my backpack"", which has built-in water bottles and places for snacks. The pronoun ""it"" is ambiguous because it could also refer to the backpack's features (water bottles and snack places). However, in this context, ""I forgot to fill the [blank]"" makes more sense if we're talking about forgetting to fill the water bottles with water."
416,1,0,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: When we go hiking I bring my backpack because it has built in water bottles and places for snacks. Today I forgot to bring the _ and was starving.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] snacks
[B] water bottles
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","After analyzing the sentence, I think the correct resolution is:

[B] water bottles

The reason is that ""it"" in the first part of the sentence refers to the backpack, which has built-in water bottles. The pronoun ""I"" in the second part of the sentence likely continues to refer to the same person who forgot to bring something from their backpack. Therefore, it's more likely that the forgotten item is a specific type of bottle or container for carrying water.

In contrast, while snacks are indeed stored in the backpack, there's no reason to assume that the forgotten item would be the snacks themselves rather than containers or wrappers for them."

Respond with one of the following choices:

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] magazine.

Here's why:

In the sentence, ""the"" refers back to ""book"". However, this creates an ambiguity because ""book"" is a singular noun, but ""magazine"" is often used as a plural noun. To resolve this ambiguity, we need to choose the option that best fits the context of the sentence.

Given that ""book"" is a singular noun and ""a magazine"" would typically refer to a single publication, it's more likely that ""the"" refers back to ""magazine"", making [A] magazine the correct choice."

Sentence: My pain was not nearly as bad as Joe's burn because the _ Joe had was uncontrollable.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] pain
[B] burn
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] burn.

In this sentence, the ambiguous pronoun ""Joe's"" refers back to ""Joe"", indicating that it belongs to Joe. Therefore, ""Joe's had was uncontrollable"" means that Joe's burn (not his pain) was uncontrollable. This resolves the ambiguity by correctly attributing the possessive noun phrase ""Joe's had"" to Joe's burn."

The sentence is saying that refraining from drinking was easy for Kyle (meaning Kyle didn't enjoy drinking), but not for Eric, because Eric never enjoyed the taste of alcohol. So, the pronoun ""who"" should refer back to ""Eric"", indicating that Eric is the one who never enjoyed the taste of alcohol."

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] sticker.

Here's why:

In this sentence, ""her"" refers back to Mary, but it could also refer to the person whose photo is on the card. To resolve the ambiguity, we need to choose an antecedent that makes more sense in context.

Since Mary is discarding something temporary, it's likely that she's getting rid of a sticker that was applied to her card or photo, rather than discarding the entire card. Therefore, ""sticker"" is the most plausible choice."

In this sentence, ""the"" refers back to ""the new cream"", which is a noun that has been previously mentioned. The pronoun ""the"" cannot refer to ""lotion"" because it would create an unclear relationship between the two nouns.

Here's why:

In this sentence, ""who"" (implied by ""_"") refers to the subject of the sentence, which is the person leasing out the house. Since it's not Kenneth who is leasing out the house (according to the accusation), the pronoun must refer to Jeffrey, as he is the one whose house was being leased out.

In this sentence, ""Jeffrey's house"" indicates that Jeffrey is the owner of the house. The pronoun ""_ is renting"" must refer back to Jeffrey, because only Jeffrey would be capable of renting the house. Therefore, the subject-verb agreement suggests that Jeffrey is renting the house.

In this sentence, ""so"" indicates a cause-and-effect relationship between the two clauses.

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] ball.

Here's why:

In the sentence, ""I give him a sausage otherwise I give him a ball"" sets up two alternatives for what to give the dog. The pronoun ""I"" in this context refers to one of these alternatives. Since the sentence describes different behaviors (good vs bad), it makes sense that the ""I"" refers to giving the ball when the dog is bad, which matches with the subsequent sentence ""I gave him the _ since he was bad.""

So, the correct completion for the blank would be [B] ball."

In this sentence, ""it"" is an ambiguous pronoun that can refer to either the plant or the garden. However, since John decided to grow a new breed of plant in his garden, it's more likely that ""it"" refers to the garden, as the description ""the _ is big"" suggests that something about the garden is notable. Therefore, choosing [A] garden resolves the ambiguity and provides the most coherent interpretation of the sentence."

In this sentence, ""so"" indicates a cause-and-effect relationship between Erin being sick of the pests and someone's decision to lay low. Since Erin is the one who was affected by the pests (being ""sick"" of them), it makes sense that she would be the one to decide what to do in response. Amy's actions are mentioned earlier in the sentence, but they don't have a direct bearing on the decision to lay low.

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] iced.

In this sentence, ""the"" refers back to ""types of coffee"", which includes both iced and hot. Therefore, it's more likely that ""the"" is referring to the iced coffee, as it's mentioned to be popular in cooler weather."

Here's why:

In the sentence, ""the barista loved to make all types of coffee"" implies that the barista makes both iced and hot coffee. Then, the phrase ""in the hotter weathers"" suggests a contrast between the hot weather and the type of coffee that's popular. Given this context, it's more likely that people prefer to drink iced coffee in hot weather, rather than hot coffee.

So, [A] iced is the choice that resolves the ambiguity!"

In this sentence, ""her"" is ambiguous because it could refer to either ""the girl"" or ""the bully"". However, since we are told that the girl put her money in the bag instead of her pocket, it makes more sense for ""her"" to refer back to the girl. Therefore, the correct choice is [B] bag."

The reason is that the pronoun ""her"" is closer to the noun ""bag"" than the noun ""pocket"".

In this sentence, ""it"" is ambiguous because it can refer to either Google or the information being searched for.

The sentence implies that the speaker who loves small dogs is Victoria, as she's the one who decided to adopt a Yorkie.

In the sentence, ""because"" introduces a subordinate clause that provides a reason why Carrie did not keep written records for someone. The pronoun ""_ had"" refers back to the subject of this clause, which is likely to be ""Laura"", indicating that it was because Laura had a sharp memory that Carrie didn't need to keep written records of their expenses.

The reason is that ""the"" in the sentence refers back to ""windows"", which are the ones that let out heat. The phrase ""kept... opened"" implies that the windows were open, allowing heat to escape.

The sentence starts by describing two people, Natalie and Jennifer, each having a different farm animal (pig and cow). The pronoun ""so"" is used to connect this information to the following clause.

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] dock

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] boat.

Explanation:

The sentence contains a pronoun ""it"" that refers to either the dock or the boat, which is ambiguous. However, the phrase ""couldn't all fit in it"" suggests that ""it"" refers to the boat, because boats have a limited capacity for passengers. Therefore, the correct resolution of the ambiguity is [B] boat."

Respond with one of the following choices:

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] pine trees.

The sentence implies that the subject performing the action of ""keeping leaves"" is the same as the subject described in the first part of the sentence, which is the pine trees. Therefore, it is more logical to assume that the pronoun refers back to the pine trees rather than the oak trees."

In this sentence, the pronoun ""who"" refers back to the subject mentioned earlier in the sentence (""Joel"").

In this sentence, ""their"" refers back to ""Benjamin's device"", as Benjamin is the one who was able to use the device for longer. The pronoun ""their"" should be replaced with ""his"" (possessive adjective) or ""his own"" (phrase) to clarify that the charger belongs to Benjamin.

So, the corrected sentence would be: Benjamin was able to use his device for longer than Steven because he remembered to bring his charger."

The sentence should read: ""Laura was thrilled to get her lip pierced but Rachel was pretty scared. Laura had hers done and cried.""

The sentence is saying that the wound responded quickly to the rubbing alcohol, which makes sense because rubbing alcohol is a solvent and can help dissolve impurities on the surface of the skin. The fact that it responds slowly to the ointment suggests that the ointment may be providing some sort of nourishment or soothing properties that take longer to take effect.

The pronoun ""which"" in this case refers back to the rubbing alcohol, making it the most efficient treatment for the wound."

In this sentence, ""the"" refers back to ""accident"", which was previously mentioned as something that required more investigation.

In this sentence, ""the"" is a pronoun that refers to either an accident or a burglary. To resolve the ambiguity, we need to choose which noun it refers to.

In this sentence, ""their"" refers back to the person who had a coach, which is Aaron. Therefore, it must be Aaron's presence that was relevant for scheduling an extra event on Saturday morning.

Well-written sentences can sometimes have ambiguous pronouns, and in this case, choosing [A] Brian wouldn't make sense because it would imply that Brian's presence at practice led to the scheduling of an extra event, which isn't what the sentence intends to convey."

In the original sentence, ""my"" refers to Snow White, as it is more likely that a costume for Snow White would be a dress. Therefore, the pronoun ""I"" is referring to the person thinking about what costume they would wear for Halloween, and since the costume is supposed to be Snow White's, the pronoun ""I"" should also refer back to Snow White.

The sentence implies that someone (either Jessica or Jennifer) likes to treat the dogs, but it's unclear which owner is being referred to.

The sentence is talking about the two owners, and it's saying that one of them (Jessica) was far worse than the other (Jennifer). The phrase ""because _ like to beat the dogs"" is referring back to one of the owners. Since we know that both owners are female, the pronoun ""_like"" needs to refer to Jennifer, as she is being described as better than Jessica.

Here's why:

* The sentence is describing a comparison between two cars (the car and the truck) and their respective engines.
* The pronoun ""the"" refers back to one of the two cars mentioned earlier in the sentence. Since it's comparing the two, it's more likely that it's referring to the truck, which hasn't been mentioned yet, rather than the car.

Here's why:

In the sentence, ""the water in the car"" refers to a specific pool or container of water inside the car. Then, the sentence says ""the engine in the ..."" and we need to determine which noun (""car"" or ""truck"") it refers back to.

Given the context, it makes more sense that the sentence is comparing the temperature of the water in the car's cooling system (which would have been heated up by the running engine) with the water in the truck's cooling system. Therefore, it's likely that the sentence means ""the engine in the car"" had run more recently.

In this sentence, ""as compared to Erin"" sets up a comparison between Monica and Erin.

The phrase ""to follow their budget"" makes more sense when attributed to the diner, as they are the ones trying to stick to their financial plan.

In contrast, if we attribute ""their"" to the food truck, it would imply that the food truck has a budget and is struggling to adhere to it, which doesn't fit with the context. The sentence would be more coherent if the food truck had a limited amount of money to spend (which is not the case).

[B] Lawrence

The reasoning is that ""he"" in the original sentence refers to a male who is training to be a race car driver. Since this person's identity is not specified within the sentence itself, we need to look at the context and consider who would be worried about this person.

[B] pushups
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] sit-ups.

In this sentence, ""her"" refers to Carla, and it's likely that Carla is doing sit-ups specifically for her abs. The phrase ""for her weak spots"" suggests that she's targeting specific areas of her abdominal muscles, making it more plausible that the action being done is sit-ups. Pushups are an exercise that targets a different set of muscles altogether.

So, the corrected sentence would be: Carla start doing sit-ups and pushups for her weak spots. The sit-ups are for her abs."
608,1,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: Carla start doing sit-ups and pushups for her weak spots. The _ are for her chest.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] sit-ups
[B] pushups
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","After analyzing the sentence, I think the correct answer is:

[B] pushups

The reason is that ""the"" in the second part of the sentence refers back to ""pushups"", which are typically performed for chest exercises. Sit-ups are usually done for abdominal exercises.

So, ""The _ are for her chest"" implies that the specific exercises being referred to are pushups, which target the chest muscles."

The sentence implies that both Dennis and Joseph are going on the trip, but the pronoun ""was"" is ambiguous because it could refer to either Dennis or Joseph. However, since the sentence says ""Joseph was also interested in fish"", it's more likely that the interest refers to Joseph, not Dennis. Therefore, [B] Joseph resolves the ambiguity."

Sentence: The man finally decided to become a guardian for the child at the orphanage because the _ was loving.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] orphanage
[B] guardian
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] orphanage.

Explanation:

In this sentence, ""the"" before ""_ was loving"" refers back to a noun that was previously mentioned in the sentence. The only two nouns that fit are ""man"" and ""orphanage"". However, it doesn't make sense for the child at the orphanage to be loving. It's more likely that the context is describing the atmosphere or environment of the orphanage, rather than the child.

Therefore, the pronoun ""the"" refers back to ""orphanage"", indicating that the orphanage was loving."

In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" is ambiguous, referring either to Angela or Rebecca.

The pronoun ""who"" refers back to the subject ""Jennifer"", indicating that it was Jennifer who wrote with a pen.

The pronoun ""was"" refers back to the subject who had to do some research, which is Samantha.

Here's why:

In the sentence, ""because _ looked the worst in frilly dresses"", the blank space refers back to the subject mentioned earlier in the sentence. Since the sentence is comparing Victoria and Sarah with regards to their suitability for the gothic Lolita style, it makes sense that the pronoun would refer to one of those two individuals.

Given the context, it's more likely that ""who"" (or in this case, ""_"") refers back to Sarah, indicating that Sarah looked the worst in frilly dresses. This reading also maintains a coherent and logical comparison between Victoria and Sarah.

In this sentence, the pronoun ""wasn't"" refers back to the subject that couldn't see any alternatives, which is Samantha. The phrase ""because wasn't nearly as open-minded"" suggests that the lack of openness in someone (who was not named) made it difficult for them to consider alternative options, and since only Samantha fits this description, it's clear that ""wasn't"" refers back to her."

In this sentence, ""as"" indicates a causal relationship between the state described and the action that followed.

In this sentence, ""the _"" is an ambiguous pronoun that can refer to either ""training"" or ""house"".

In this sentence, ""as"" is a coordinating conjunction introducing a contrastive clause, which implies that the subject of the verb ""was"" is also the one who frequently suffered from hair loss. Since Erin is the one mentioned to be suffering from hair loss, it makes sense that she is also the one described as never being stressed out. Samantha's healthy hair is used for contrast, highlighting Erin's situation.

So, the sentence is saying that Erin frequently suffers from hair loss while having a contrasting experience of not being stressed out."

Here's why:

In the sentence, ""the woman pierced ... nose"" is a dependent clause that describes the action performed by the woman. The phrase ""because the _ was numb"" modifies this clause and indicates the reason for piercing the nose. To make sense of the sentence, we need to connect the ""numb"" phenomenon to the part that was just pierced. Since it's unlikely that someone would pierce their own tongue or nose (although people do some weird things!), it makes more sense to assume that the numbness refers to the nose being pierced.

Therefore, [B] nose resolves the ambiguity in the sentence."

[B] nose

This is because the sentence implies that the woman pierced both the customer's tongue and their nose, but is only concerned about the sensitivity of the nose at this point.

Explanation: In this sentence, ""the"" is a pronoun that refers back to ""shirts"". The phrase ""were hanging on the hanger"" describes how the shirts were arranged.

* The sentence starts by saying ""Dennis did not enjoy their afternoon"", which means that ""their"" refers to Dennis's afternoon.

Here's why:

* ""Their"" can refer to either Dennis or Hunter, but since ""Dennis did not enjoy their afternoon"", it must refer to Dennis.

The sentence states that ""Beautiful to Angela"" refers to something physical, and ""it's mental to Emily"".

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] boots

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct resolution is:

[A] boots

Explanation: In this sentence, ""my"" modifies ""boots"", not ""socks"". Therefore, the pronoun ""I"" in the second clause refers to the person trying on the boots. The sentence implies that the narrator's feet are too small for the new boots, so they couldn't get them on."

The sentence is describing a situation where the speaker is trying to put on new boots, but they're having trouble because they're too large.

Sentence: The hair stylist gave Laura hair extensions and not Katrina because _ had very short hair.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Laura
[B] Katrina
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Laura.

Here's why:

In this sentence, ""had"" is a verb that refers to the subject who has very short hair. The pronoun ""had"" can only refer to Laura or Katrina, because they are the only two people mentioned as receiving hair extensions. Since it would be illogical for someone to give themselves hair extensions, we know that ""had"" must refer to one of these two individuals.

Since the sentence states that Laura received hair extensions, and implies that this is why she didn't get them, it's likely that ""had"" refers to Laura. This means that Laura has very short hair.

Therefore, [A] Laura is the correct answer."

In this sentence, ""an instinctive baker"" refers to Angela, implying that she has a natural talent for baking without needing a recipe. The pronoun should refer back to the subject who needs a recipe to mix a cake, which is Angela.

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Craig

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","After analyzing the sentence, I believe the correct answer is:

[B] Dennis

The reasoning is that ""their"" implies a shared experience or possession, which is more likely to refer to the shake (a single drink) rather than cereal. Since Dennis had the shake, it makes sense for him to be the one finishing drinking their breakfast.

So, the resolved sentence would be: ""Dennis finished drinking their breakfast."""

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] flannel shirt.

Here's why:

In the sentence, ""the _ is old"" refers to a shirt that Carl wants to replace with a new one. The pronoun ""he"" in the previous clause (""He wanted..."") is likely referring to Carl, and it makes sense for Carl to be talking about his own shirt being old.

Therefore, the phrase ""the _ is old"" must refer to the flannel shirt, which Carl wants because his epaulette shirt is old."

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] demand.

The original sentence should read:

""The demands of the job are too much.""

Here, ""demands"" is a noun that refers to the expectations or requirements of Garrett's job. The pronoun ""of the job"" is modifying the noun ""demands"", indicating that it is referring to the requirements of his job that are too much for him.

So, option [A] ""demand"" resolves the ambiguity by providing a singular noun that agrees with the subject-verb agreement in the sentence."

In the first clause, ""his toys and his books"" refers to Ben's possessions, so it implies that he respects his toys and books. In the second clause, however, the pronoun ""the"" seems to refer back to the same set of things (""toys and books""). The sentence is trying to say that it was difficult for Ben to respect his books because they were fun (e.g., picture books or comics). If we choose [A] toys, the sentence would imply that Ben had trouble respecting his toys because they were fun, which doesn't make sense."

The sentence suggests that Angela is the subject who practiced humility regularly, and ""Angela"" is the correct antecedent for the pronoun ""_"".

Here's my reasoning:

The sentence states ""Neil's cat"" was terrified of thunderstorms. This suggests that Neil is the owner of a cat that has a specific reaction to thunderstorms.

Later in the sentence, ""_ found their cat hiding under the bed..."" implies that the person (whoever it is) is finding someone else's cat, not their own. Since we already established that Neil's cat was terrified, it makes sense for Neil to be the one whose cat is being referred to as ""their"" in this context.

Therefore, I choose [A] Neil as the correct answer!"

In this sentence, ""them"" is a pronoun that refers back to ""the pig feet"". The phrase ""looked outside and decided the weather was poor enough"" suggests that the speaker is considering whether to cook or smoke the pig feet outdoors.

In this sentence, ""lacked the patience needed"" is a phrase that describes the subject performing the action in the sentence. The sentence implies that someone (either Craig or Nick) lacked the patience needed to coach Nick in soccer. Since the sentence states that Craig grew frustrated trying to coach Nick, it's likely that the pronoun refers to Nick, who lacks the patience."

The pronoun ""he"" refers back to ""the musician"", and it's more likely that the musician would sound quieter in a quiet space like an auditorium rather than a noisy space like a park.

[A] auditorium

The reason is that ""he"" refers back to ""the musician"", and it makes sense for a musician to sound louder in an auditorium (a large, enclosed space designed for musical performances) rather than at a park. The sentence implies that the musician's amplified sound carries well in the auditorium, whereas it might not be as loud at the park."

The pronoun ""the"" refers back to ""scotch"", which was introduced earlier in the sentence as the alternative drink being served.

In the sentence, ""the"" is a pronoun that refers back to something mentioned earlier in the text.

The correct choice is [A] cilantro.

In the sentence, ""the"" is ambiguous because it could refer to either ""cilantro"" or ""beef"".

The sentence should read: ""Christopher declined when asked by Ian to play a game of chess because Ian liked to play intellectual games.""

In this corrected sentence, the pronoun ""Ian"" refers back to the noun ""Ian"", resolving the ambiguity.

In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers back to the ""juice that spilled on the carpet"", which has sunk deep.

The sentence implies that the landscaping looked better in front of the house, which suggests that the owners of the house are the ones who used a hardworking company to maintain the landscaping. This interpretation makes sense because it's more likely for homeowners to take pride in their property and invest in good landscaping services.

In contrast, choosing [B] cottage would imply that the owners of the cottage are the ones who hired a hardworking company, but this doesn't necessarily follow logically from the sentence. The sentence seems to be comparing the two properties, with the implication being that the house is the one that benefited from the good landscaping."

Here's why:

* The pronoun ""them"" refers back to ""an audition"", which was requested by Nelson.

Here's why:

* The sentence starts by mentioning ""they decided to donate the couch...""

Sentence: Michael had less money than Samuel did because _ liked to shop and spend money too much.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Michael
[B] Samuel
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] Samuel.

The reason is that ""than"" introduces a comparison between two people (Michael and Samuel), and the subject-verb agreement suggests that the verb ""liked"" should refer to the same person being compared. Therefore, it must be Samuel who liked to shop and spend money too much."

Sentence: I didn't do well on my exam even though I did all the problems in the textbook correctly. I guess the questions in the _ were just too hard.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] exam
[B] textbook
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","After analyzing the sentence, I think the correct resolution is:

[B] textbook

Here's why:

The first part of the sentence mentions ""my exam,"" which clearly refers to an external entity (the exam taken by the speaker). Then it talks about doing all the problems in the textbook correctly. This implies that the textbook and the exam are two separate things.

In the second part of the sentence, the phrase ""questions in the"" is ambiguous because it could refer to either the exam or the textbook. However, since the previous mention of ""my exam"" has established that as a distinct entity, it's more likely that ""the"" refers back to the textbook (which was previously mentioned as being done correctly). This resolves the ambiguity and makes sense in the context of the sentence.

Therefore, I choose option [B] textbook."

In this sentence, ""the"" refers back to a specific thing mentioned earlier in the sentence - the ancient Egyptian dress.

[B] number

The reason is that the sentence mentions ""phone numbers"" earlier, and the pronoun refers back to those phone numbers. The monogram of the company is visible from a distance, but the phone numbers require a closer look.

So, the corrected sentence would be: ""i had to walk closer to the board to see the **numbers**, only the monogram of the company is visible from a distance."""

The sentence implies that since two teachers are mentioned (Patricia and Christine), one of them must be the subject that ""doesn't read aloud a lot"". Since Patricia teaches Kindergarten students, it's likely that they have more younger students who require more hands-on activities than reading.

The pronoun ""she"" refers back to one of the two teachers mentioned in the sentence, and since Patricia teaches Kindergarten students, it is likely that ""she"" refers to Christine, who teaches High School students.

Sentence: Jason missed his work shift in order to finish his research paper, because the _ was less important.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] work shift
[B] research paper
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct resolution is [B] research paper.

Explanation:

In this sentence, ""his"" refers back to the noun it modifies, which is either ""work shift"" or ""research paper"". Since Jason missed his work shift in order to finish something (i.e., complete an activity), it implies that he prioritized finishing the research paper over attending his work shift. This suggests that ""his research paper"" was less important than his work shift, which is unlikely. Therefore, ""his"" must refer back to ""research paper"", indicating that Jason's research paper was less important.

So, the sentence would read: Jason missed his (research) work shift in order to finish his research paper, because the research paper was less important."

The sentence is structured such that ""Steven"" is the subject performing the action of being worried, and therefore it makes sense for him to be the one described as ""short"".

Explanation: The pronoun ""their"" is ambiguous, but since the sentence states that Joel has experience driving large vehicles and Lawrence doesn't, it's more likely that Joel drives their RV with accuracy.

In this sentence, the pronoun ""so"" indicates a contrast between the two girls' behaviors.

In this sentence, ""because"" introduces a clause that provides a reason for the fear described earlier in the sentence.

This resolution makes sense because it's likely that Benjamin's childhood experiences would not be the reason why William has this particular fear.

The sentence implies that ""there"" refers back to ""more snow"", which makes sense only if it's talking about the north. If it were referring to the south, it would mean there was more snow in the south, which wouldn't make the statement about warmth of clothing true.

So, the resolved sentence is: The clothing in the north was warmer than the clothing in the south because there was more snow in the north."

Explanation: The sentence is describing a contrast between the north and the south.

In this sentence, ""it"" is a pronoun that refers back to the noun ""steak"". The sentence implies that the flavor of the steak needs to be enhanced with the artisan pepper. Therefore, ""the steak"" is the most likely referent for the pronoun ""it"", making option [A] the correct choice."

The original sentence is ambiguous because ""it"" could refer to either the rib-eye steak or the artisan pepper.

Here's why: The sentence implies that since Christine didn't believe in life after death, she (Christine) never tried to talk to spirits. The pronoun ""she"" refers back to Christine because it's more likely that someone who doesn't believe in the supernatural wouldn't try to communicate with spirits. Samantha, on the other hand, believed in life after death, so she might have been more inclined to try talking to spirits.

The sentence implies that the cleanliness of the shoe depends on where James jogs, and the pronoun ""it"" refers to the state of being clean. Since it is said that ""it is not always the same when jogging on the lawn"", it means that the lawn is a different environment from the street, and therefore the shoe may not need to be washed as thoroughly after jogging on the lawn.

In this sentence, ""it"" refers back to the shirt that Felicia burned while ironing it.

The sentence implies that ""the place where she belonged during the dance"" refers to the location where she felt most comfortable or at ease while performing, which is the stage.

Here's why:

In this sentence, there are two characters: Derrick and Kenneth. The pronoun ""they"" is ambiguous because it could refer to either person. However, since the sentence describes an action that requires someone else's agreement or permission (""said""), it makes more sense for ""they"" to refer to Kenneth, who was previously mentioned as the one needed to go to the store.

The sentence suggests that Samantha was present at court and was being told by Christine why her (Samantha's) license had expired.

Therefore, the pronoun ""had"" should refer back to Samantha."

In this sentence, ""since"" is used to introduce a reason or explanation, and it's referring back to the subject who performed the action (bought popcorn and drinks).

In this sentence, ""as"" introduces a contrasting clause that provides additional information about why someone (either Christopher or William) never applied for a passport. Since Christopher was able to travel abroad, it makes sense that he had not needed a passport because he did not have to travel internationally. Therefore, the pronoun ""had"" should refer back to Christopher.

So, the corrected sentence would be: ""Christopher was able to travel abroad, while William only travelled domestically, as Christopher had never applied for a passport."""

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] concrete.

The pronoun ""as the"" refers back to the previous noun phrase ""the rubber"". The sentence is saying that the rubber resisted the rock, but then it snapped on the concrete because the concrete was abrasive. So, the pronoun ""as the"" is modifying ""concrete"", indicating that the concrete's abrasiveness caused the rubber to snap.

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] panels.

In this sentence, ""his"" is ambiguous because it can refer to either Al or the possessive noun ""house"". However, since the phrase ""solar panels and a small generator"" is the object of the verb ""got"", it's more likely that ""his"" refers to Al's. This means that the main power supply would be Al's solar panels, making [A] the correct choice.

The sentence could also be rewritten as: ""Al got solar panels installed at his house for electricity as they would be his main power supply."" This would make it clear that the pronoun ""his"" refers to Al's."

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] low.

In this sentence, ""they"" refers back to ""newborns"", which are the ones being fed food during an experiment. The phrase ""high and low calorie experiment"" indicates that there are two types of foods: high-calorie and low-calorie. Since the newborns were fed ""low-calorie"" food, it makes sense for them to be described as ""hardy"". If they were fed high-calorie food, it would imply that they became less hardy, which doesn't fit with the intended meaning.

Here's why: The sentence suggests that Justin became ill and was in need of care, so it makes sense that he would be the one to finally go home once his illness had improved. Matthew is providing soup to help Justin recover, but there's no indication that Matthew himself is going home. Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers back to Justin."

In this sentence, the pronoun ""was"" is ambiguous and could refer to either Erin or Lindsey.

The sentence should read: ""She said that the dog did not violate the lease at all.""

The sentence starts by describing a situation where ""it"" smelled better near the pool. Then, it compares this to how ""it"" smelled near the compost. To resolve the ambiguity, we need to choose the option that makes sense in both contexts.

Erin's lack of vast knowledge is what makes her unlike Sarah.

So, the resolved sentence would be: Sarah had to call in an expert unlike Erin because Sarah had vast knowledge on the subject."

In this sentence, ""the"" in the second clause refers back to the noun ""furniture"", not ""toy"".

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] apple.

The sentence should read: ""The student wanted to be respectful to the teacher so he got her a book instead of an **apple** because it was old.""

Here's why:

* ""So"" introduces a consequence, which implies that the student chose to get something for the teacher as a replacement.
* ""Instead of"" indicates that the student was considering giving the teacher something else (in this case, an apple), but decided against it.
* If we assume ""book"" is the one that's old, then the sentence would imply that the teacher wanted a book, not an apple. This doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.
* Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the book is new, and the student chose to give it to the teacher instead of an old apple.

By choosing [B] apple, we resolve the ambiguity by making the sentence coherent and logical."

The sentence should read: ""The life of Christine was pretty basic until they met Maria, and she is a lover of excitement.""

Here's why:

* ""they"" refers back to ""Christine"", as it would be unusual for someone else to meet Maria.
* Therefore, the pronoun ""_ is a lover of excitement"" must refer to Christine, indicating that she is a lover of excitement.

In this sentence, ""Megan"" and ""Patricia"" are the two individuals who have different career aspirations. The sentence implies that Megan wanted to be a welder, but instead chose to attend university (not trade school). Therefore, it is more likely that ""went to university instead of trade school"" refers to Megan's actions.

The pronoun ambiguity arises because we don't know which person is the subject of the verb phrase ""went to university"". However, based on the context and the sentence structure, it is most plausible that Megan is the one who decided to attend university."

The reason is that ""longer"" implies a comparison to something else, and it's more likely that the man took longer to pay for the shoes because they are often more expensive or complex to purchase than a shirt. The fact that he paid in coins suggests that it was a small transaction, which would support this interpretation.

Explanation:

In this sentence, ""the"" refers back to ""boots"" and ""shirts"", but it's unclear which noun ""the"" should modify. The pronoun ""their"" already modifies both ""boots"" and ""shirts"". To resolve the ambiguity, we need to choose the option that makes more sense in the context.

Changing boots is a common practice, especially if they're dirty or uncomfortable. Changing shirts might not be as necessary, but it's still possible in certain situations (e.g., for hygiene or uniform purposes). The sentence suggests that the commander is primarily concerned with the state of the privates' boots, implying that ""the"" refers to ""shirts"", which are being left unchanged.

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] baseball.

Here's why:

The sentence implies that Jack wants to play a sport with his friends, but he's having trouble deciding between baseball and basketball. The phrase ""fewer of friends"" suggests that Jack has a larger group of acquaintances who would be interested in playing baseball, whereas the smaller number of players required for basketball makes it more feasible for a smaller group of close friends.

This interpretation is supported by the fact that baseball often requires a larger number of players (9 on each team) compared to basketball (5 on each team). Therefore, [A] baseball resolves the ambiguity and provides the most coherent meaning."

Sentence: The teenager chose a jeweled pin for her belly piercing, but the _ was too tiny.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] piercing
[B] pin
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] pin.

The sentence implies that the subject (the teenager) chose a jeweled pin for her belly piercing, and then refers to ""it"" as being too tiny. Therefore, ""pin"" is the most likely candidate to fill the blank, as it would make sense for the pin itself to be too small rather than the piercing.

The phrase ""was too tiny"" implies that the subject is referring to the physical object (the pin), rather than an abstract concept like a piercing."
1018,0,1,"Your task is to resolve the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence.
Sentence: The teenager chose a jeweled pin for her belly piercing, but the _ was too huge.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] piercing
[B] pin
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] piercing.

Explanation:

In the sentence, ""her"" refers to the subject ""teenager"", and the pronoun ""was"" is ambiguous. It could refer to either the pin or the piercing.

To resolve the ambiguity, we can choose an option that makes sense in context. Since the sentence describes a person getting pierced, it's more likely that the issue is with the piercing itself being too huge, rather than the pin being too huge.

Therefore, [A] piercing resolves the ambiguity and provides a coherent meaning for the sentence."

[B] Maria

The reason is that Maria is the one being described as a pain in the neck, and it makes more sense for Maria to be the one laying down the prank trap. Christine was tired of Maria's behavior, so it's likely that Maria is the one responsible for setting up the prank.

So, [B] Maria resolves the ambiguity!"

In this sentence, ""their"" refers back to ""family"", which is a noun that can be possessed by either Derrick or Christopher. However, since ""provide for their family"" implies that someone is taking care of a family related to them, it's more likely that the pronoun ""their"" refers to Derrick, who is the one quitting school to provide for his family.

Christopher is simply being informed about this decision, so he wouldn't be providing for their family. Therefore, the ambiguity is resolved in favor of [A] Derrick."

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Katrina

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] Victoria.

The sentence implies that Victoria was the one who added salt, so it's likely that she's the one who felt bad and vowed not to season again. This interpretation also makes more sense in terms of the context: if Katrina had made the bland food and Victoria just added salt, it would be strange for Katrina to feel bad about seasoning.

So, the resolved sentence would read: ""The food Katrina made was very bland, so Victoria added some salt; Victoria felt bad and vowed not to season again."""

Respond with one of the following choices:

Here's why:

* The sentence starts by mentioning ""his coworker"", which establishes that the referent is a person.
* Later in the sentence, there is an ambiguous pronoun (""the _ will do it for more money"") that could potentially refer to either a person (Jason) or a company (painting company).
* However, given the context and the fact that Jason hired someone to paint his house, it makes more sense that ""the _"" refers back to ""his coworker"", implying that Jason is aware that his coworker will do the job for more money.

Therefore, [A] coworker resolves the ambiguity by providing a clear referent for the ambiguous pronoun."

Sentence: The crops in the facility grew better than in the greenhouse since the _ was bright inside.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] facility

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] greenhouse.

Here's why:

* ""better"" implies a comparison between two things.
* The sentence describes how the crops grew in two different locations: ""in the facility"" and ""in the greenhouse"".
* The word ""since"" indicates that the reason for the growth difference is something about one of those locations. Specifically, it's saying that something about the greenhouse made the crops grow better there.
* Therefore, it makes sense to assume that the bright light is referring to the greenhouse, not the facility. This resolves the ambiguity.

So, the sentence should read: ""The crops in the facility grew better than in the greenhouse since the greenhouse was bright inside."""

In this sentence, ""is"" is a linking verb connecting the clause to the predicate nominative ""a receiver in general"". Since ""Dennis"" is the intended recipient of the roses, it is the most likely candidate to be referred to by the pronoun ""is"".

The pronoun ""it"" is ambiguous because it could refer to either the phone or the laptop, but the sentence implies that the battery in question is a phone's battery, which makes sense given the context. The phrase ""the phone died faster than..."" suggests that the speaker is comparing the performance of the phone's battery with that of the laptop's battery.

Therefore, the correct resolution of the ambiguous pronoun is [A] phone."

The sentence implies that Felicia ran out of shirts and borrowed one from Patricia, but someone (either Felicia or Patricia) didn't ask permission ahead of time. Since it's unlikely that Patricia wouldn't ask permission to borrow a shirt from herself, the most natural interpretation is that ""who"" refers back to Felicia, indicating that she didn't ask permission ahead of time."

In this sentence, ""he"" refers back to ""the man"". The phrase ""when he was younger"" indicates that we're talking about the same person as in the first part of the sentence.

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] Jessica.

The sentence implies that the patches being referred to are ones that belong to Jessica, not Elena. Therefore, ""her"" in the phrase ""her pants"" should be replaced with ""Jessica's"", making the pronoun unambiguous. The original sentence is actually ambiguous because it doesn't specify whose patches are being used, but choosing [B] Jessica resolves this ambiguity by indicating that the patches belong to Jessica."

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Logan
[B] William
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Logan.

Sentence: Brian wanted a horse but not Nick because _ raised cattle in their spare time.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Brian

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","I would choose [B] Nick.

The phrase ""not Nick"" indicates that it is Nick who does not raise cattle, implying that Nick does not have a suitable hobby to raise cattle in their spare time. Therefore, the pronoun ""their"" should refer back to Nick.

So, the corrected sentence would be: Brian wanted a horse but not Nick because he raised cattle in his spare time."

[A] Elena
[B] Rachel
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Elena.

In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" refers back to the subject ""Elena"", who is the one receiving a pet gecko for her birthday. This resolution makes sense because it's Elena who liked lizards more than Rachel did, so it would be logical that she would receive a pet gecko as a gift.

So, [A] Elena resolves the ambiguity in this sentence!"

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Logan
[B] Kyle
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct resolution is:

[B] Kyle

Explanation: In this sentence, ""so"" indicates a causal relationship between the two actions (snowboarding and biathlon). Therefore, it implies that both Logan and Kyle went up the hill because they either wanted to snowboard or do biathlon. Since Kyle is the one who wants to do biathlon, it makes sense for him to be the one who goes up the hill.

So, option [B] resolves the ambiguity correctly!"

In this sentence, the pronoun ""was"" refers back to the closest noun that makes sense in the context. In this case, it's the ""rose"", which was previously mentioned as having been watered. The phrase ""the soil of the X was already wet"" implies that the condition being described is relevant to the rose, rather than the cactus."

Sentence: She watered the rose but not the cactus, because the soil of the _ was already dry.

[B] cactus
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] rose.

In this sentence, ""the"" in the phrase ""soil of the ..."" refers back to the subject ""rose"", which was previously mentioned and described as having been watered. This resolution is supported by the fact that cacti are typically drought-tolerant and would not require watering due to dry soil. Therefore, it makes sense that the sentence is describing the state of the rose's soil rather than the cactus's."

[B] underwear

Here's why: In the original sentence, ""his"" can refer to either Kelly (the subject) or the toga (which is also referred to as ""his""). However, if we replace ""his"" with a more specific pronoun, it becomes clear that the toga is the one wearing the underwear.

So, the corrected sentence would be: ""Kelly was embarrassed when his toga fell off at the party and people saw the underwear because the toga was too tight.""

If I were you, I'd choose [B] underwear!"

In this sentence, ""who"" is a pronoun that needs to be resolved. The original sentence implies that there are two people being compared (Kayla and Rachel), but it doesn't specify which one ""enjoyed eating brioche and butter every morning"".

In this sentence, ""the"" refers back to ""a program"", making it clear that the subject is the new program. The pronoun ""it"" would be more natural here, but since ""is"" is used instead of ""it"", we can infer that the intended meaning is that the new program itself is new.

[B] Megan

The reason is that the pronoun ""is"" should refer back to the subject ""Megan"", as it's describing her current employment status. The phrase ""but not Megan"" is setting up a contrast between Tanya and Megan, so the pronoun should point to Megan.

So, the corrected sentence would be: Tanya recently finished filling out a job application but not Megan because she is currently unemployed."

In this sentence, ""because"" indicates a cause-and-effect relationship between the two clauses.

Since we're talking about one person being busy while another has finished the task, it makes sense to conclude that the subject performing the action in the main clause (""is currently working"") is Megan.

In this sentence, ""overweight"" and ""emaciated"" are descriptive words that refer to the physical condition of two people. The pronoun ""_ needed to go on diet"" is ambiguous because it could refer to either Patricia or Felicia.

However, based on the context and the sentence's meaning, it is more likely that the sentence is describing a situation where one person (Patricia) needs to go on a diet because they are overweight, while another person (Felicia) already has a low weight and does not need to go on a diet.

Explanation:

* The sentence starts by describing two individuals, Benjamin and Ian, with their respective opinions about phone systems.

Sentence: Elena is concerned that Megan might have a Twitter addiction, but _ is probably worrying about nothing.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Elena
[B] Megan
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Elena.

In this sentence, ""is probably worrying about nothing"" refers back to Elena, indicating that she might be overestimating the situation. The pronoun ""is"" should be replaced with ""she"", but since English doesn't allow a subject-verb agreement with a possessive pronoun (""her""), we use the singular subject pronoun ""Elena"" instead.

So, the sentence would read: Elena is probably worrying about nothing."

Sentence: Donald was chosen to be a model while Dennis was passed over, because _ was exceptionally tall.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Donald
[B] Dennis
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Donald.

In the sentence, ""because"" introduces a relative clause that provides more information about why Donald and Dennis were considered for the modeling job. The pronoun ""was"" refers back to the subject of the main clause, which is ""Donald"". Therefore, the sentence implies that it was Donald who was exceptionally tall, not Dennis."

Sentence: The flour spills out when we use an ancient family recipe and pour three teacups of flour into our bowl. The _ is too small.
Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] teacup
[B] bowl
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] bowl.

Explanation: The sentence states ""three teacups of flour into our bowl"". This implies that the teacups refer to a measurement unit, and it makes sense that the bowl would be considered too small if it can't hold three teacups of flour. Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" (referring to ""the bowl"") is likely referring to the bowl, rather than one of the teacups."

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] chemical.

The sentence suggests that ""the"" refers to the product as a whole, which makes it more likely that the unapproved entity is the chemical component rather than the container. This resolution also creates a coherent and logical sentence, implying that the FDA had not approved the use of the new chemical in any disease cure."

Here's why: The sentence implies that both the cracker and the cookie were given to the speaker, but only the cracker was stale. Therefore, it is more logical to assume that ""the"" refers back to the cookie, which is being compared to the stale cracker."

The pronoun ""her"" in the sentence refers to April, and the sentence implies that the relaxation is for April after she finishes waterskiing.

In this sentence, the pronoun ""were"" refers back to the subject ""documents"", indicating that they are the ones whose completeness was accepted by immigration.

In this sentence, ""knew"" is ambiguous between ""Jennifer knew"" (i.e., Jennifer had knowledge) and ""Rachel knew"" (i.e., Rachel had knowledge).

The pronoun ""he"" refers back to Derrick, who is mentioned as not liking to use a hookah, and it is implied that he does not like to use a hookah.

Respond with one of the following choices:

[B] table
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] table.

Explanation:

In this sentence, ""the"" refers back to ""table"", not ""desk"". The pronoun ""the"" should refer to the noun that is being described by the phrase ""appeared to be common"". Since the description is about the table's value and worthiness of an appraisal, it makes sense for ""the"" to refer back to ""table""."

[B] clock

The pronoun ""his"" refers back to the noun ""alarm clock"", not the ""headphone"". The sentence suggests that John was sleeping with a headphone on his head, and then it mentions that the alarm clock is farther. Therefore, it makes more sense for ""his"" to refer to the clock's location.

In this sentence, ""had"" refers to Emily, as it is more likely that Emily was pregnant and gave birth to a baby girl, rather than Tanya.

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Ryan
[B] Randy
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] Ryan.

Here's why:

In this sentence, ""it"" would be a more natural pronoun to use instead of ""_"". Since Ryan ordered the salad with added avocado, it implies that Ryan was okay with the $3 upcharge. Randy passed on ordering the salad, so Randy wouldn't care about the upcharge.

The ambiguity arises because we don't know who is referred to by the implied ""it"". But given the context, it's more likely that Ryan would be okay with the upcharge since they're the ones who ordered the salad."

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] Tanya
[B] Samantha
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [B] Samantha.

Here's why:

In the sentence, ""while"" indicates a contrast between two situations or states. The first part of the sentence describes Tanya as an adult, implying that she has already grown up and doesn't need her old clothes anymore. In contrast, Samantha is described as young and still having room to grow, which suggests that she is in a stage of development where she might still need her old clothes.

The phrase ""so _ gave her her old clothes"" implies that someone is giving their old clothes to Samantha, because she needs them. The ambiguity arises from the fact that we don't know who this someone is. However, given the contrast between Tanya's adult state and Samantha's youth, it's more likely that Samantha is the one doing the giving, rather than Tanya.

Therefore, [B] Samantha is the correct choice to resolve the ambiguity."

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","After analyzing the sentence, I think the correct resolution is:

[B] Lawrence

The reasoning is that the pronoun ""was"" is referring back to ""Michael"", but the clause it's attached to describes the reason for his unhappy relationship.

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] street
[B] lawn
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] street.

Here's why:

The sentence starts by describing James' feelings when he walked the length of his street. Then, it says he decided to walk just the length of his lawn. The pronoun ""his"" in ""his lawn"" refers back to James', so the sentence is saying that James has a lawn and a street, and he used to walk along his street but now only walks along his lawn.

The word ""the"" in ""The _ is long"" is meant to refer back to the thing that was walked - which is either the street or the lawn. Since we know James' street is the one being described as long, it's more likely that ""his"" refers to James' street, making [A] street the correct answer.

(B) Lawn doesn't make sense here because there's no indication that James has a particularly long lawn!"

Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","The correct answer is [A] street.

Here's why:

* ""He"" is ambiguous because it could refer to either James or the person doing the walking (assuming a third-person narrative).
* However, if we resolve the pronoun to refer to James, then the sentence would imply that James feels weak whenever he walks his own street. This makes sense, as it's more likely that someone would feel tired after walking their own long street.
* If we resolve the pronoun to refer to the person doing the walking (instead of James), then the sentence would suggest that some third person is walking James' street and feels weak. This doesn't make sense in this context.

So, by choosing [A] street, we resolve the ambiguity to create a coherent and logical sentence."

In this sentence, the pronoun ""was"" refers back to the subject of the sentence, which is ""the girl"". Since the girl broke Leslie's heart, it implies that Leslie was in love with the girl. Therefore, the sentence resolves as: The girl broke Leslie's heart because Leslie was never in love with her.

This interpretation makes sense grammatically and contextually, whereas choosing Kenneth wouldn't make sense since the sentence is describing why Leslie's heart was broken, not Kenneth's."

This is because the sentence states that remodeling came naturally to Michael, implying that he was skilled in carpentry.

The reason is that ""he"" is likely referring back to the same person who got up and got a bowl, rather than the soap. The sentence implies that he reached for something (soap) first, then stood up and obtained another item (a bowl). Therefore, it makes more sense for ""close by"" to refer to the bowl, which is a tangible object that could be physically close by.

In this sentence, ""hated"" is a verb that describes the subject performing the action.

Respond with one of the following choices:
[A] aquarium
[B] tortoise
Which choice resolves the ambiguity?","I would choose [A] aquarium.
